# Image-Classification-of-Vegetables-with-Noise-Augmentation

---
## âœ… Important Points from Project Description  

### ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
- **Objective:** Create a model to classify **15 different categories of vegetables** using the **MobileNet model**.
- **Application:** Deploy the model on **mobile devices** as an initial product and MVP.
- **Challenge:** Achieve an accuracy of **98%** (due to similarity with ImageNet and availability of pre-trained MobileNet weights on ImageNet).

### ðŸ“Œ Project Steps  
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Training data was obtained through web scraping and search queries.  
   - Validation data was collected by a group of operators.  
   - Test data was prepared by the client company (**only half of the data was provided; the other half is kept by the client for final evaluation**).  

2. **Initial Review & Issues:**  
   - The initial model implementation by a junior employee only achieved random accuracy.  
   - The code was handed over to you for debugging and improvement.

### ðŸ“Œ Dataset Link  
- [Download Dataset from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DFgrzdBgVzXGYm_wRPas2q80tpPGWVH/view?usp=sharing)  
- It is recommended to save the ZIP file to your own Drive and continue working from there.  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Recommendations & Limitations  
- Perform debugging primarily on the **CPU** to avoid issues related to the absence of a **GPU**.  

---

### ðŸ“Œ Final Objective  
- Provide a model with the **highest possible accuracy**.  
- Document **all modifications, errors, and fixes**.  
- Suggest **improvement steps** if the desired accuracy is not achieved (**Provide scientific reasons for each step**).
